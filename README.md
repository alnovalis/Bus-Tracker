<h1>TITLE OF PROJECT</h1>
<p>Bus Tracker</p>

<h2>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>This project uses MBTA bus data to determine stops on the #23 bus route. An animated marker on the map highlights the bus route when one clicks on "Track Bus Stops for Bus #23." The marker moves from one bus stop to the next one on the map.</p>
