<h1>TITLE OF PROJECT</h1>
<p>Bus Tracker</p>

<h2>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>This project uses MBTA bus data to determine stops on the #23 bus route. An animated marker on the map highlights the bus route when one clicks on "Track Bus Stops for Bus #23." The marker moves from one bus stop to the next one on the map.</p>

<h2>HOW TO RUN</h2>
<u1>
<li>Clone this repository.</li>
<li>Open up the index.html file in the browser.</li>
<li>Click the "Track Bus Stops for Bus #23 button.</li>
<li>Watch the marker move along the bus route.</li>
<li>Check the console to see the current bus data appear every 30 seconds.</li>
</u1>

<h2>FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS</h2>
<p>In a later integration, the marker on the route map will move in real time as the #23 bus moves from one bus stop to the next.</p>
