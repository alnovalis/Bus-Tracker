This project uses MBTA bus data to determine stops on the #23 bus route. An animated marker on the map highlights the bus route when one clicks on "Track Bus Stops for Bus #23." The marker moves from one bus stop to the next one on the map.

In a later integration, the marker on the route map will move in real time as the #23 bus moves from one bus stop to the next.
